## Introduction
This is a simple-to-use flashcard application that allows users to create, edit, and delete flashcards, which they can then review.
While this was originally created for the purpose of studying Japanese, it can be used for any subject. You can generate decks of vocabulary
for the JLPT N5, N4, N3, N2, and N1 levels, or create your own custom decks and cards. Thanks to [GitHub user Wkei](https://jlpt-vocab-api.vercel.app), whose API I used to generate the JLPT decks.
This application was created using Python and the PySide6 library, and uses the SM-2 algorithm to determine when to show cards for review.
